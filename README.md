# About
This repo contains the shell of a code which may become an R packge to access the [College Scorecard datasets](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/) via the provided [API](https://github.com/18F/open-data-maker/blob/api-docs/API.md)

## Status

1.  As of September 12th, the morning of the press release, it appears that an API key is needed  
2.  The code is currently not functional


## Ideas

Out of the gate, I intended to provide baseline functionality within an R package to access data.  Over time, or with help, perhaps we can use this repo to support the larger functionality of the api, such as multiple data formats (json and csv) as well as specific queries.
